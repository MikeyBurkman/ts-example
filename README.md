# ts-example
Example backend application in TypeScript

### Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

This will start the server on port 3000. Go to `localhost:3000` to verify it's working

### Re-building
- If you're using Atom (or another editor) with the correct TypeScript plugin, new JS files should be compiled and added to the `dist` folder automatically.
- You can manually rebuild by running `npm install` again.
